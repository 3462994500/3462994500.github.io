I am currently a graduate student majoring in [information and communication engineering](https://scie.cqupt.edu.cn/) at [Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications ( CQUPT )](https://www.cqupt.edu.cn/). I entered school in 2023 and studied under Professor [Shen Bin](https://xueshu.baidu.com/scholarID/CN-B974DMOJ).  During the master 's degree, the main research direction is UAV communication, which has certain research experience in the field of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. The laboratory is [the key laboratory of mobile communication technology of CQUPT](https://klmc.cqupt.edu.cn/index.htm). 

I received my Bachelor 's degree in [Communication Engineering](https://txgcxy.cuit.edu.cn/) from [Chengdu University of Information Technology ( CUIT )](https://www.cuit.edu.cn/). The main research direction is embedded, learning embedded software and hardware development in the communication innovation laboratory of the college.
