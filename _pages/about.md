<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a graduate student majoring in [information and communication engineering](https://scie.cqupt.edu.cn/) at [Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications ( CQUPT )](https://www.cqupt.edu.cn/). I entered school in 2023 and studied under Professor [Shen Bin](https://xueshu.baidu.com/scholarID/CN-B974DMOJ).  During the master 's degree, the main research direction is UAV communication, which has certain research experience in the field of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. The laboratory is [the key laboratory of mobile communication technology of CQUPT](https://klmc.cqupt.edu.cn/index.htm). 

I received my Bachelor 's degree in [Communication Engineering](https://txgcxy.cuit.edu.cn/) from [Chengdu University of Information Technology ( CUIT )](https://www.cuit.edu.cn/). The main research direction is embedded, learning embedded software and hardware development in the communication innovation laboratory of the college.

- Modeling multi-UAV three-dimensional coverage scenes in partially observable environments and constructing a multi-dimensional evaluation system. Modeling Dec-POMDP process and improving it 
The DQN network structure, combined with the multi-head graph attention mechanism GAT to model the dynamic topological relationship between agents, combined with GRU to capture the temporal state evolution, to achieve local 
Observation information sharing and distributed collaborative decision-making. The global reward index of the proposed method is 2.69 % higher than that of the traditional algorithm and 8.77 % higher than that of the two-dimensional trajectory scheme.
